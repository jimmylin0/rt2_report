# Particle MCMC for Inference in State-Space Models
Information for the RT2 report for people at the STOR-i RT2 poster session. The poster due to space constraint emphasises focus on the PMMH methodology, the report titled 'Filtering and Inference for State-Space Models' which can be seen in the files introduces particle filters and particle MCMC in more detail, and also details issues such as particle degeneracy and alternative resampling methods.
